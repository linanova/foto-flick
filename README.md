# Foto-Flick

Puzzle slide with Flickr images.

This puzzle game uses the Flickr API to get the most recently uploaded image, resizes and crops the image as appropriate, splits it into a 3x3 tile board, shuffles the tiles up, and allows a player to slide the tiles around and try to reassemble the original image.

<div align="center">

Written as an introductory exercise to React.
